# Memory_Tic-tac-toe
Memory_Tic-Tac-Toe adds an exciting twist to the classic game by introducing a memory-based mechanic. After your third move, one of your blocks will become 50% transparent, signaling that it will disappear soon. Your opponent will also see this transparent block before they make their third move. Once they place their third move, the block returns to normal. However, when you make your fourth move, the transparent block will vanish completely, keeping the game fresh and adding an element of surprise. This mechanic prevents ties and challenges players to think ahead. Try it out and see if you can outwit your opponent!
